## [6.5] - 2026-08-05

### Added
- Cross-platform event subscriptions with `Event` enum and `@rpc.on()` decorator (PR [#66](https://github.com/Senophyx/Discord-RPC/pull/66) by @SuperZombi)
- `AssetManager` with `RPC.assets` property and `.get()` / `.names` for fetching Discord application assets (PR [#60](https://github.com/Senophyx/Discord-RPC/pull/60) by @SuperZombi)
- `Asset` object support in `set_activity()` — pass `rpc.assets.get("key")` directly as `large_image` / `small_image`
- `utils.get_assets(app_id)` function to fetch assets without initializing `RPC`
- `RPC.connected` read-only property as alias for `self.ipc.connected` (PR [#63](https://github.com/Senophyx/Discord-RPC/pull/63) by @SuperZombi)
- `InvalidEvent` and `InvalidEventType` exceptions exported from the package root
- `utils.required_url()` for validating required button URLs
- `examples/rpc-events.py` showing event subscription usage
- `User.avatar_decoration` and `Application.cover` CDN URLs (PR [#67](https://github.com/Senophyx/Discord-RPC/pull/67) by @SuperZombi)

### Changed
- IPC reads now preserve the opcode and route responses by nonce through a single background reader
- Windows imports are now loaded only on Windows; the blocking reader no longer needs `msvcrt` or `win32pipe`
- URL validation now checks the scheme and host instead of only a prefix
- `set_activity()` now validates button URLs client-side
- Bumped GitHub Actions versions: `checkout@v4→v6`, `setup-python@v4→v6` (PR [#62](https://github.com/Senophyx/Discord-RPC/pull/62) by @SuperZombi)
- Link badges in `README.md` now point to local `CHANGELOG.md` and `DOCS.md` instead of `senophyx.id`
- `DOCS.md` documentation URL in `pyproject.toml` updated to point to GitHub

### Fixed
- Invalid method annotations in `_send()` and `_request()` that prevented importing the package
- Unread `PONG` responses no longer corrupt subsequent RPC requests
- Incoming `PING` packets are answered with `PONG`
- Handshake no longer requires a nonce and reads the READY frame directly
- Event subscription state no longer mixes callback storage with subscription state
- Failed subscriptions no longer register callbacks locally
- Reader thread stops after the last unsubscribe and is cleaned up during disconnect
- `subscribe()` returns `True` for already-subscribed events so stacked handlers work
- Pipe is marked disconnected when the reader stops idle, allowing reconnect
- `pyproject.toml` license uses the PEP 621 table so wheel builds succeed
- Indentation in `examples/assets.py` corrected to 4 spaces
- `User.__str__`, `Application.__str__`, `Asset.__str__`, and `Asset.__repr__` reformatted to multi-line for codebase consistency

### Documentation
- Added `avatar_decoration`, `cover`, URL validation helpers, and `remove_none` to `DOCS.md`

## [6.0] - 2026-07-21

### Added
- `name` parameter to `RPC.set_activity()` (optional, falls back to Discord application name if not provided) (PR [#58](https://github.com/Senophyx/Discord-RPC/pull/58) by @SuperZombi)
- `ping_every` parameter to `RPC.run()` for configurable OP_PING heartbeat interval
- External URL image support for `large_image` and `small_image` (direct HTTP URLs now supported alongside asset keys)

### Changed
- `User` and `App` refactored from instance attributes to `@cached_property` -- lazy-loaded and read-only after first access (PR [#58](https://github.com/Senophyx/Discord-RPC/pull/58) by @SuperZombi)
- `RPC.get_app_info()` method removed; access application info via `rpc.App` property directly
- Activity payload building inlined from `_build_activity()` back into `set_activity()` for simplicity
- Shared pipe connection logic extracted into `_BasePipe` class, eliminating DRY violations between `WindowsPipe` and `UnixPipe`
- `Button()` function renamed to `button()` for PEP8 compliance
- `TRY_RECONNECTING` global converted to instance attribute `self.try_reconnecting`
- Internal logging variables renamed for specificity
- `urllib.request` and `json` imports in `utils.py` moved to top level

### Fixed
- Socket timeout prevention: OP_PING heartbeat now sent every 15 seconds by default in `RPC.run()`
- Log handler duplication across multiple RPC instances
- `logging.basicConfig()` removed to avoid polluting user's logging configuration
- Global variable declaration order causing `SyntaxError` on some Python versions
- Overly broad `except KeyError` in `handshake()` methods
- `UnixPipe._recv()` data truncation on large payloads
- `set_activity()` return type annotation corrected from `bool` to `Optional[bool]`
- `self.connected` now properly set from `_connect_pipe()` return value instead of defaulting to `True`
- Broken button arguments in `print-rpc-output.py` example

### Documentation
- Rewrote `DOCS.md` with updated API reference and corrected codebase changes
- Added `CHANGELOGS.md` with full release history from v2.0
- Added clear activity and all-in-one complex RPC examples
- Added external URL image support information to docstrings and examples

## [5.6] - 2026-06-14

## [5.0] - 2024-03-13

### Changed (Breaking)

  Before:
  ```py
  rpc = discordrpc.RPC.set_id(app_id=1234567890)
  ```

  ```py
  rpc = discordrpc.RPC(app_id=1234567890)
  ```

### Removed
- Multiple internal functions removed:
  - `RPC.set_id`
  - `RPC._connect`, `RPC._write`, `RPC._recv`, `RPC._recv_exact`
  - And many more internal methods

### Changed
- Package `logging` reintroduced for output
- `timestamp` argument in `set_activity()` replaced with `ts_start` and `ts_end`
- `timestamp` variable moved to `discordrpc.utils`:
  ```py
  from discordrpc.utils import timestamp
  ```

- Added `debug` parameter to `RPC` class for verbose logging

### Added
- `date_to_timestamp()` function in `discordrpc.utils` (format: `%d/%m/%Y-%H:%M:%S`)

## [4.0] - 2023-09-11

### Changed (Breaking)
- **Package folder renamed from `DiscordRPC` to `discordrpc`.**

  Before:
  ```py
  import DiscordRPC
  ```

  After:
  ```py
  import discordrpc
  ```
